## Hi, I'm Eric! ðŸ‘‹

I started my journey learning to code in high school.  I continued expanding my skills in college, while obtaining my B.S. in Information Technology at Oakland University.  After graduation though I took a job in IT support that didn't require any programming skills. After ten years, needing a career change, I had an opportunity to go through an internal coding bootcamp at a previous job.  I had forgotten how much I enjoyed the challenges and problem solving that came with programming.  I've been working as a software engineer since and am continuing to grow and learn new skills.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working my way throufh a list of Udemy courses I've collected.  Between work, school, and trying to have a life, it's hard to find time, but I try.  I also have a few ideas for personal projects floating around in my head that I'd like to get to after I finish school.

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently back in school, pursuing a second degree.  This time a B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering at Southern New Hampshire University.  I've had opportunities to use Python, Java, and C++ through the various classes as well as learn some OpenGL, MongoDB, writing programs for embedded systems, using Android Studio to create a mobile app in Java, and using Jupyter Notbooks, Python, and TensorFlow to learn about and practice different methods of machine learning.<br /><br />At the same time, I am continuing to expand my frontend and backend skills in C# and Typescript every day at my job.  I've also been expanding my knowledge around CI/CD, writing config files for CircleCI and GitHub Actions workflows.  I'm also starting to get into IAC and K8s with my work, which has been a learning experience.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning Swift and about iOS app development, as well as learning Ruby.  I'm also interested in learning more about infrastructure as code and Kubernetes (some brief exposure on a project got me interested in learning more about those).
