# Hi, I'm Eric! ðŸ‘‹

I started my journey learning to code in high school.  I continued expanding my skills in college, while obtaining my B.S. in Information Technology at Oakland University.  However, after graduation I took a job in IT support that didn't utilize my programming knowledge. After ten years, and needing a career change, I had an opportunity to go through an internal coding bootcamp at a previous employer.  I'd forgotten how much I enjoyed the challenges and problem solving that came with programming.  Since then I've been working as a software engineer and am constantly looking to continue growing and learning new skills!

- ðŸ”­ Current work: I'm currently working my way through a list of Udemy courses I've collected.  Between work, family, and trying to have a life, it's hard to find time, but I try.  I also have a several ideas for personal projects floating around in my head that I'm starting to get organized and work on.

- ðŸŒ± Learning: In addition to my B.S. in Information Technology from Oakland University, I recently completed my second degree, a B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering from Southern New Hampshire University.  Between both degrees I've had opportunities to use Python, Java, and C++, as well as learn about OpenGL, MongoDB, writing programs for embedded systems, using Android Studio to create a mobile app in Java, and using Jupyter Notebooks, Python, and TensorFlow to test out different methods of machine learning.<br /><br />At the same time, I am continuing to expand my frontend and backend skills in C# and JavaScript/Typescript through my work, as well as gain valuable experience writing SQL queries for relations databases.  I've also been expanding my knowledge around CI/CD, building workflows for GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, and CircleCI.

- ðŸ‘€ Interests: Iâ€™m interested in learning Swift and about iOS app development.  I'm also interested in learning more about infrastructure as code and Kubernetes (some brief exposure on a work project got me interested in learning more).

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Feel like reaching out for some reason, you can reach me at [eric@ericslutz.dev](mailto:eric@ericslutz.dev) and say hi.
