## Hi, I'm Eric! ðŸ‘‹

I started my journey learning to code in high school.  I continued expanding my skills in college, while obtaining my B.S. in Information Technology at Oakland University.  However, after graduating I took a job that didn't need any programming skills. After ten years, needing a career change, I had an opportunity to go through a coding bootcamp at my work.  I had forgotten how much I enjoyed the challenges and problem solving that came with programming.  I now have a job as a software engineer and am continuing to grow and learn new skills.

- ðŸ”­ I'm not currently working on any personal projects.  Between work, school, and trying to have a life, it's hard to find time.

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently back in school, pursuing a second degree.  This time a B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering at Southern New Hampshire University.  As part of earning this degree I am learning Python, Java, and C++ as they are all used through the various classes.  At the same time, I am continuing to expand my frontend and backend skills in C# and Typescript every day at my job.  I've also been expanding my knowledge around CI/CD, writing config files for CircleCI workflows.  I'm also starting to get into IAC and K8s with my work, which has been a learning experience.  Additionally, I've managed to collect several Udemy courses covering a range of topics I would like to complete.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning Swift and about iOS app development.  I'm also interested in learning Ruby.
