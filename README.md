### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Eric.  I started my journey learning to code in middle school and high school.  I continued exapnding my skills in college, while obtaining my B.S. in Information Technology from Oakland University.  However, after graduating I took a job that didn't need any programming skills. After ten years, needing a carrer change, I had an opportunity to go through a coding bootcamp through my work.  I had forgotten how much I enjoyed the challenges and problem solvng the came with programmiing.  I now have a job as a software engineer and am continuing to grow and learn new skills.

#### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...

I'm not currently working on any personal projects.  Between work, school, and trying to have a life, it can be hard to find some time for that.  

#### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...

I'm currently back in school, pursuing a second degree.  This time a B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering.  As part of earning this degree I am learning Python, Java, and C++ as they are all used through the various classes.  At the same time, I am continuing to expand my skills in C# and Typescript every day at my job.  Additionally, I've managed to collect several Udemy courses I'd like to complete. I'm also interested in learning Swift and learning about iOS app development.
